# [WIP] Sparkify
This is project 1 of the [Udacity Data Engineer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027). As of this commit I'm about halfway through the project. The goal is to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) and the second dataset is JSON logs generated by [this event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim).

I'll flesh this out more as the project progresses.
## Purpose of the database
[TODO] Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
## Schema explanation and rationale
[TODO] State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.

## Example queries
[TODO] [Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.


In order for the `COPY` command to work, the user doing ETL (`student`) must have  `pg_read_server_files` permissions.

I was able to accomplish this by logging in as a super and running this:
```grant pg_read_server_files to student;```
